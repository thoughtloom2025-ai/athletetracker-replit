## Current Status (December 2024)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- **Authentication System**: Fully functional Replit Auth with session management
- **Core Application**: React frontend with mobile-first responsive design
- **Data Storage**: Complete in-memory storage system with all CRUD operations
- **UI Components**: Full shadcn/ui component library with light/dark theme support
- **API Endpoints**: All REST endpoints implemented and tested
- **Application Pages**: Dashboard, Students, Events, Attendance, and Reports pages
- **Form Management**: Student and Event forms with validation

### üîß Current Configuration
- **Session Storage**: MemoryStore (in-memory sessions)
- **Data Persistence**: Memory-based storage for all application data
- **Authentication**: Working Replit Auth integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database provisioned but not yet connected

### üöÄ Next Steps for Production
1. **Database Migration**: Update DATABASE_URL to point to the Neon PostgreSQL instance
2. **Schema Migration**: Run `npm run db:push` to create tables in PostgreSQL
3. **Storage Migration**: Switch from MemoryStorage to DatabaseStorage in `server/storage.ts`
4. **Session Storage**: Optionally migrate sessions to PostgreSQL for persistence across restarts
5. **Data Migration**: Consider seeding initial data or providing import functionality

### üìù Development Notes
- All database schemas are defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM
- Storage interface is consistent between memory and database implementations
- Application is fully functional with current in-memory storage
- Authentication and session management working correctly
